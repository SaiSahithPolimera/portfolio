When I was studying for my diploma, I often wondered how the subjects I was learning applied to the real world. It was challenging to understand how all the pieces fit together. However, in my fifth semester, I had the opportunity to work on a project that changed my perspective. We were tasked with picking an idea and building a project around it.

I proposed the idea of creating a helpful aid for blind individualsâ€”one that could detect obstacles and alert users in real time. To my delight, my team members embraced the idea. However, we faced a significant challenge: our studies had primarily focused on programming, and none of us had any hands-on experience with sensors or controllers.

Seeking guidance, I turned to my sister, who recommended Tinkercad. This platform allows users to simulate the functionality of electronic components, and it was a game-changer for us. It was exhilarating to see our ideas take shape in a virtual environment.

As we delved into the project requirements, we realized the need for sensors and a microcontroller to develop a working prototype. This revelation marked the beginning of a steep but rewarding learning curve. I spent countless nights exploring the intricacies of the Arduino microcontroller, learning how to send inputs and receive outputs.

I discovered the Arduino IDE, a platform for writing Arduino-based programs and uploading code to the microcontroller. The coding language, similar to C++, was another hurdle I had to overcome. However, with the abundance of tutorials and resources available online, I gradually became proficient.

One of the key features we wanted to incorporate was an emergency button. We envisioned a simple mechanism that would allow blind users to press a button and instantly share their live location with a designated family member.

The most challenging aspect of the project was integrating the GPS and GSM modules to send messages while simultaneously processing signals from the ultrasonic sensor, which calculated the distance between the user and obstacles. Initially, this seemed like an insurmountable task. However, thanks to the wealth of tutorials and online posts, we successfully developed a working prototype by the end of the semester.

This project was more than just an academic exercise; it was a profound learning experience that combined programming, electronics, and a deep understanding of user needs. It demonstrated the potential of technology to create meaningful solutions that can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with disabilities.
