- Remind yourself regularly that you are better than you think you are. Successful people are not supermen. Success does not require a super intellect. Nor is there anything mystical about success. And success isn't based on luck. Successful people are just ordinary folks who have developed belief in themselves and what they do. Never-yes, never-sell yourself short.

- *Believe Big. The size of your success is determined by the size of your belief*. Think little goals and Expect little achievements. Think big goals and win big success. Remember this, too! Big ideas and big plans are often easily certainly no more difficult-than small ideas and small plans.

- The thinking that guides your intelligence is much more important than how much intelligence you may have.

- The story is told that the great scientist Einstein was once asked how many feet are in a mile. Einstein's reply was "I don't know; Why should** **I fill my brain with facts I can find in two minutes in any standard reference book?" Einstein taught us a big lesNoteD facts. Use your mind to create and develop ideas, to find new and better ways, to do things. Ask yourself, "Am I using my mental ability to make history, or **am I using it merely to record history made by others**?"

- Remember, it's not how many brains you've got that matters. Rather, it's how you use your brains that counts. Manage your brains instead of worrying about how much IQ you've got.

- You can't let your mind go negative and think it's too late. Stop thinking "I should have started years ago." That's failure thinking. Instead think, I'm going to start now, my best years are ahead of me." That's the way successful people think

- *Action cures fear*

- Isolate your fear. Pin it down. Determine exactly what you are afraid of.

- Deposit only positive thoughts in your memory bank

- When we do what is known to be wrong two negative things happen. First, we feel guilt and this guilt eats away confidence. Second, other people sooner or later find out and lose confidence in us.

- *To think confidently, act confidently.*
